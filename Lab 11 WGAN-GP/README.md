# Lab 11 WGAN-GP
This lab aims to provide an in-depth understanding of Wasserstein Generative Adversarial Networks with Gradient Penalty (WGAN-GP), with particular emphasis on the Generator and Discriminator architectures, as well as advanced training techniques like Hinge Loss and Gradient Penalty. This lab utilizes PyTorch for implementation and TensorBoard for visualization.

## Core Concepts
* WGAN-GP: Uncover the fundamentals of Wasserstein GANs improved with Gradient Penalty, and its role in generative modeling.
* Generator and Discriminator: Examine the architecture and role of the Generator and Discriminator in a WGAN-GP, focusing on conditional GANs.
* Hinge Loss: Study the Hinge Loss and its benefits in the context of training GANs.
* Gradient Penalty: Explore the mathematical underpinning and implementation of Gradient Penalty for stable and meaningful training.
