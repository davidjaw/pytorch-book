# Lab 8: Load Pretrained Model from Pytorch

This Lab simply shows how to load a pretrained model from Pytorch hub, and use `tensorboard` to visualize the model. 
The model is loaded and tested on a dog image from the pytorch official github repository.
In this lab, `Inception v3`, `ResNet-50`, `MobileNet-v3` are tested.

## Core concepts
* Basic usage of `torch.hub`
