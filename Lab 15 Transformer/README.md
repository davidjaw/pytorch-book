# Lab 15 Transformer
In this laboratory session, participants will delve into the fundamental concepts and practical implementations of sequence models, with a particular emphasis on the Transformer architecture. This session is designed to provide comprehensive insights into various sequence modeling techniques such as RNN, LSTM, GRU, and Transformers, employing the IMDb dataset for text classification tasks.

## Core Concepts
* Dataset Utilities: Participants will explore the robust dataset utilities provided by PyTorch. The session includes a detailed walkthrough on how to effectively load and preprocess text data, leveraging PyTorch's built-in functionalities. This part aims to equip learners with the skills needed to handle data efficiently in a machine learning workflow.
* Sequence models: This module introduces the architectural frameworks and operational principles of different sequence models. Starting from the basics of RNNs, the discussion will extend to more advanced models like LSTMs and GRUs, culminating with an in-depth analysis of the Transformer model. Each model's design and utility in handling sequential data will be dissected to provide a clear understanding of its application and performance in real-world tasks.
* Training & Validation: The focus will then shift to the practical aspects of training these models. Participants will engage in setting up training loops, understanding and implementing various metrics, and managing the tokenization of text data. Special attention will be given to the mechanisms of masking in Transformers to prevent information leakage during training. This section is crucial for understanding how to effectively train, validate, and fine-tune sequence models to achieve optimal performance.
