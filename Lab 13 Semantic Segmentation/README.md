# Lab 13 Semantic Segmentation
This lab dives deep into the field of semantic segmentation using deep learning. Utilizing the PyTorch library, we will walk you through the process of building, training, and validating different semantic segmentation models on the Oxford-IIIT Pet dataset. Semantic segmentation is an essential task in computer vision, allowing models to understand images at a pixel level by classifying each pixel into a specific category.

## Core Concepts
* Dataset Utilities: Explore the dataset utilities provided by PyTorch, and how to use them to load and preprocess data.
* Semantic Segmentation Models: Understand the architecture and working principles of different semantic segmentation models like SegNet, SegUNet, and SegMobileUNet.
* Combination of torch hub model and custom model: Learn how to combine a torch hub model with a custom model to design a new network architecture.
* Training & Validation: Dive into the training loop, understand the importance of different metrics used in semantic segmentation like IoU, Precision, and Recall. Learn how to visualize training results and metrics using TensorBoard.
