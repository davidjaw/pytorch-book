# Lab 14 Advanced CNN Architectures
This lab takes a step forward from the previous chapter and delves into more recent CNN architectures for semantic segmentation. Leveraging the capabilities of PyTorch, this chapter will walk you through the practical re-implementation of computational blocks of modern CNN architectures such as ResNeXt, ConvNeXt-v2, and the CSP-Net. These blocks have been seamlessly integrated into our segmentation models for the Oxford-IIIT Pet dataset, giving you hands-on experience with state-of-the-art techniques.

## Core Concepts
* Dataset Utilities: Just like the previous chapter, learn about the dataset utilities offered by PyTorch and their application in loading and preprocessing data, and designing custom evaluation metrics.
* Modern CNN Architectures: Dive deep into the recent architectures, understanding the intricacies of computational blocks like ResNeXt, ConvNeXt-v2, and CSP-Net.
